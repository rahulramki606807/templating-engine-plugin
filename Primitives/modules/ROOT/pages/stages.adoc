== Stages

Stages are a primitive that allow you to group together steps to be
called at once in order to avoid repetition in the pipeline template.

Stages are defined by through the `stages` key, with subkeys becoming
available as steps within your pipeline template.

A common example would be creating a continuous integration stage:

[source,]
----
stages{
    continuous_integration{
        unit_test
        static_code_analysis
        build
        scan_artifact
    }
}
----

and then in your template:

[source,]
----
continuous_integration()
deploy_to dev 
----
