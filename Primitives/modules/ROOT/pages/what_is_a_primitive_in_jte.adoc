== What is a primitive in JTE?
In JTE, primitives are constructs leveraged largely for syntactic sugar to make pipeline 
templates more reader friendly. 

JTE provides several primitives by default and it is possible to extend the Jenkins Templating
Engine plugin with your own plugin providing additional primitives.
