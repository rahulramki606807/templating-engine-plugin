== Application Environments

The Application Environment primitive exists to simplify referencing
deployment targets from pipeline templates.

=== Configuration File Specification

The `application_environments` key is used to begin declaring
application environments.

Within the application environments block, environments can be defined
through subkeys. These subkeys will be used to reference the environment
from your pipeline template.

By default, application environments accept an optional `short_name` and
`long_name` configuration. These values will be set to the value of the
environment name if not overridden.

An example specification defining a `dev` and `prod` environment would
be:

[source,]
----
application_environments{
    dev{
        long_name = "Development" 
    }
    prod{
        long_name = "Production" 
    }
}
----

Then within a pipeline template, assuming there is a pipeline step
called `deploy_to` that accepts an application environment as an
argument, you could reference these objects via

[source,]
----
build()
deploy_to dev
test()
deploy_to prod 
----

=== Additional Configurations

The Application Environment primitive can also accept an arbitrary
number of additional configuration fields.

This often comes in handy when libraries provide steps that accept an
application environment as an input parameter. Configurations for the
library across all environments would be defined in the library spec,
while environment specific configurations would be defined on the
environment.

Suppose there was an ec2 library that accepts a `ssh_credential_id`
configuration that specifies a Jenkins credential ID containing the ssh
key to access both instances and an `ip` configuration supplying the IP
for the environment to scp an artifact to.

The configuration file for such a situation could be:

[source,]
----
application_environments{
    dev{
        long_name = "Development" 
        ec2{
            ip = "1.2.3.4" 
        }
    }
    prod{
        ec2{
            ip = "1.2.3.5" 
        }
    }
}

libraries{
    ec2{
        ssh_credential_id = "ssh_credential" 
    }
}
----

Refer to link:../../Library_Development/1/getting_started.html[Library Development] for more information on
how to build libraries that can leverage this pattern.
