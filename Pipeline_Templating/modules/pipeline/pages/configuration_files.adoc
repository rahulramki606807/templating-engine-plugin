== Configuration Files

With the Jenkins Templating Engine, configuration files are used to
populate templates with the information necessary to execute.

The configuration file is a groovy file named `pipeline_config.groovy`
that gets placed at the root of the source code repository or within a
pipeline configuration repository.

=== Syntax

The configuration file is a custom groovy domain specific language
intended to avoid the burdensome syntax of JSON without the whitespace
pitfalls of YAML.

While the flexibility of what can be done within a configuration file is
limited by the link:../../../Pipeline_Templating/1/pipeline/configuration_file_sandboxing.html[sandbox], the file is executed as a groovy
script and builds a configuration object.

The configuration file acts as a nested builder language will accept any
arbitrary configuration. Beyond several JTE configuration fields, it is
up to specific primitives and libraries to provide meaning to the keys
and values provided within a configuration.

An example configuration file would be:

[source,]
----
// restrict individual repository Jenkinsfiles 
allow_scm_jenkinsfile = false 

// define application environment objects 
application_environments{
    dev{
        long_name = "Development"
    }
    prod{
        long_name = "Production"
    }
}

/*
  define libraries to load. 
  available libraries are based upon the 
  library sources configured. 
*/
libraries{
    github
    sonarqube
    docker
    // library configurations are determined by 
    // the specific library implementation
    openshift{
        url = "https://example.openshift.com"
        cred_id = "openshift" 
    }
}
----

=== Configurations

==== Application Jenkinsfiles

By default, if there is a Jenkinsfile in an application source code
repository it will be executed as the pipeline template.

When using JTE to share a common pipeline template across multiple
applications an organization may want to prevent individual repositories
from providing their own pipeline templates for governance.

To disable this default behavior, specify
`allow_scm_jenkinsfile = false` within a governance tier's configuration
file.

For a full overview of how governance works with JTE, check out the
link:../../../Governance/1/governance_model.html[Governance Model].

==== Template Methods

The JTE model is similar in design to the
https://dzone.com/articles/design-patterns-template-method[Template
Method Design Pattern]. A template is defined which invokes abstract
methods (steps) yet to be defined.

These methods are then implemented by either steps from the libraries
loaded or the
link:../../../Primitives/1/default_step_implementation.html[default step implementation].

As a result, situations may arise where a step is called from a template
that has not been implemented via the available options. In some cases,
this is acceptable.

The `template_methods` block of your configuration file is used to
declare the steps that will be called from your template. In the event
that a step is called that has not been defined, it will be routed to
the default step implementation if it's name appears in the
`template_methods` block.

By default, JTE provides the following default values for
`template_methods`.

[source,]
----
template_methods{
    unit_test
    static_code_analysis
    build    
    scan_container_image
    penetration_test
    accessibility_compliance_test
    performance_test
    functional_test
}
