== What is a pipeline template?

=== Templates

When developing a pipeline used by multiple teams, you'll often find
that the workflow is the same while the specifics of what each step in
the process does may differ between applications.

Whether the application is a Java app packaged as a war and deployed to
an AWS EC2 instance or a React app being statically bundled and deployed
to an S3 bucket or Nginx instance, the steps in your pipeline are the
same.

In this example, both applications could have a pipeline workflow that
performs unit testing, static code analysis, packaging an artifact, and
deploying that artifact to an application environment.

You would represent this workflow in a template! Templates are built by
calling steps and referencing primitives defined in your pipeline
configuration file.

=== Steps

Pipeline steps are methods supplied by pipeline libraries that implement
a specific action in your pipeline template. In your pipeline
configuration file you will specify what libraries should be loaded.

Each of these libraries will contribute steps that can be called from
your pipeline template.

In our simple example, a pipeline template could be defined as follows:

[source,]
----
unit_test()
static_code_analysis()
build()
deploy_to dev 
----

This template could be reused by multiple teams using different tools by
creating link:../../../Library_Development/1/getting_started.html[libraries] which implement the pipeline steps
`unit_test`, `static_code_analysis`, `build`, and `deploy_to`. Once
these libraries are created, a configuration file is created to specify
which libraries to load.

For the deployment step, you'll notice that a `dev` application
environment was referenced to specify where the deployment should take
place. This `dev` application environment is an example of a primitive
that can be defined alongside your template in the configuration file.

=== Primitives

Primitives are template constructs whose purpose is to make the pipeline
template as simple and easy to read as possible.

The default primitives currently supported are link:../../../Primitives/1/application_environments.html[Application Environments], link:../../../Primitives/1/keywords.html[Keywords], and link:../../../Primitives/1/stages.html[Stages].

It is possible to write a Jenkins Plugin that extends the Jenkins
Templating Engine to add a
link:../../../Custom_Primitive/1/index.html[custom primitive].

=== Configuration Files

To complete this example, we can build out sample pipeline configuration
files for each application.

Configuration files provide the information necessary to populate a
pipeline template with what's needed to execute.

For our example, we can define a common pipeline configuration to be
inherited by both applications that defines the development application
environment and a common SonarQube pipeline library to perform the
static code analysis:

[source,]
----
// define common application environment 
application_environments{
    dev{
        long_name = "Development" 
        ec2{
            ips = [ "1.2.3.4", "1.2.3.5" ]
            credential_id = "ec2_ssh" 
        } 
        s3{
            url = "https://s3.example.com"
            path = "content/" 
            credential_id = "s3_bucket" 
        }  
    }
}

// define pipeline libraries common between applications
libraries{
    merge = true 
    sonarqube // supplies the static_code_analysis step 
}
----

For the Java application:

[source,]
----
libraries{
    java  // supplies the build step 
    junit // supplies the unit_test step 
    ec2   // supplies the deploy_to step 
}
----

For the React application:

[source,]
----
libraries{
    React // supplies the build step 
    jest  // supplies the unit_test step 
    s3    // supplies the deploy_to step  
}
----

You would then create a link:../../../Governance/1/governance_model.html[Governance Tier] to point JTE
to your common configuration and place the application specific
configurations at the root of their source code repository in a file
called `pipeline_config.groovy`.
