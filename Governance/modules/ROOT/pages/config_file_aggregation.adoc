== Configuration File Aggregation

When creating Governance Tiers to define your governance hierarchy, you
can create configuration files to consolidate common configurations
while tuning which aspects can be modified or overwritten by
suborganizations in the hierarchy.

JTE provides some
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkinsci/templating-engine-plugin/master/src/main/resources/org/boozallen/plugins/jte/config/pipeline_config.groovy[common
configurations] by default. The first configuration file found in the
hierarchy will automatically override keys in common between the default
configuration and the configuration file being loaded.

After the first configuration file, each subsequent file will only be
able to *add new root configuration keys* and any configuration that
overlaps with the existing configuration will be ignored *unless* the
parent configuration has explicitly allowed a configuration block to be
modified via the `merge` and `override` keys.

Setting `merge = true` in a configuration block will allow the next
configuration file in the hierarchy to append configuration keys to the
block.

Setting `override = true` in a configuration block will allow the next
configuration file to replace the existing configuration block.

You can see some examples of these keywords in action
link:pages/Pipeline_Templating/configuration_files[here].

Each configuration file in the Governance Tier hierarchy will be
combined according to these rules until there is a resultant aggregated
pipeline configuration. It is this aggregated pipeline configuration
that gets used to populate the selected pipeline template for execution.
