== Governance Tier

Templates define the business logic of the pipeline and a configuration
file is used to implement the functionality of the template.

If you would like to leverage the templating capabilities of JTE without
sharing workflows between applications, you can place a `Jenkinsfile`
template at the root of your application's source code repository
alongside the `pipeline_config.groovy` configuration file.

If you would like to consolidate templates or common configurations, you
can put organizational templates and common configurations into a
*Governance Tier*.

Governance Tiers consist of link:../../Pipeline_Templating/1/pipeline/configuration_files.html[Configuration Files], link:../../Library_Development/1/library_sources/library_sources.html[Pipeline Libraries], and link:../../Pipeline_Templating/1/pipeline/what_is_a_pipeline_template.html[Pipeline Templating].
