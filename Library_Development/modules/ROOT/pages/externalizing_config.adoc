//[[Externalizing Library Configuration]]
== Externalizing Library Configuration

One of the major benefits of organizing your pipeline code into
libraries is the ability to reuse these libraries across different
teams.

In order to achieve this level of reusability, it's best to externalize
hard coded values as parameters that can be set from the pipeline
configuration repository.

=== Creating an Example Step

To demonstrate how to do this, let's create a step that simply prints a
message a specified number of times, with both the message and number of
times printed being values passed via the configuration file.

==== Repository Structure

[source,]
----
README.rst 
example/
    printAThing.groovy
----

With this source code repository configured as a Library Source, we
would be able to load the `example` library from our pipeline
configuration repository and invoke the `printAThing()` step from a
pipeline template.

==== Library Configuration

When writing a library step, a `config` variable comes autowired into
your scope that can be referenced to access configurations defined in
your library block from the configuration file.

Let's create a configuration parameter `number` to represent the number
of times to print the message and a configuration parameter `message` to
represent the message to be printed.

*pipeline_config.groovy*:

[source,]
----
libraries{
    example{
        number = 3
        message = "my message to be printed!" 
    }
}
----

==== Step Declaration

We can now write our library step to access these parameters directly on
the `config` variable automatically provided to the step.

====
To access the number of times to print the message, read the
`config.number` value. To access the message to be printed, read the
`config.message` value.
====
*printAThing.groovy*:

[source,]
----
void call(){
    for(def i = 0, i < config.number, i++){
        println config.message 
    }
}
----

==== Conclusion

We learned how to access external library configurations via the
pipeline configuration repository. These parameters can be any
serializable data type and are accessible from within your step via the
autowired `config` variable.

====
The pipeline step we built today has some flaws. It does not guarantee
that the number of times to print the message is an Integer or that the
message to be printed is a String. For next steps, learn how to link:../../Library_Development/1/validate_library_parameters.html[validate library 
parameters].
