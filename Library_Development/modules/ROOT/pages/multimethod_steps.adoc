== Multi-Method Steps

It is sometimes advantageous to define more steps than just the call
method.

Within the context of creating templates, this pattern comes up when
defining internal methods used by library steps as opposed to being
invoked directly by a template.

For example:
[source,groovy]
----
def printMessage(String message){
    println "the message is ${message}" 
}
----
[caption = test_step.groovy]

creates a step `test_step` that can be invoked via:

[source,groovy]
----
test_step.printMessage("example!")
----
