== SCM Library Provider

The SCM Library Provider allows you to configure a source code
repository containing your libraries.

To configure, you'll need to provide the scm specific (git, etc)
properties such as repository URL and credential to access the remote
repository. You can also provide the base directory within which the
library directories can be found.
