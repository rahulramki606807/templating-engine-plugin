== Library Sources 
The Jenkins Templating Engine provides a mechanism for using the same 
pipeline across multiple applications, regardless of what tools they are using. 

To do this, there has to be a way to organize different implementations of the 
same step.  For example, if two teams are using gradle and maven to build their 
respective applications via a ``build`` step invoked from a template - then there 
must be a way of storing and labeling these different implementations. 

That's where libraries come in.  In this example, we would create a ``maven`` 
and ``gradle`` library, each contributing a ``build`` step via a file called 
``build.groovy``. 
[NOTE]
.Note
====
As this example illustrates, you can think of the pipeline templates you create
as an api that libraries and link:../../../Pipeline_Templating/1/pipeline/what_is_a_pipeline_template.html[primitives] implement.  Therefore, libraries that are meant to be interchangeable should contribute steps with the same name. This way, multiple teams can use the same pipeline template by specifying different libraries to load in their pipeline configuration file. 
====
A **Library Source** is a reference to a place from which libraries can be found for loading. 

Following the governance model JTE lays out, Library Sources can be defined globally under 
``Manage Jenkins >> Configure System >> Jenkins Templating Engine`` and become available 
to every pipeline on the Jenkins instance.  

Alternatively, access to libraries can be scoped to jobs within a Folder in Jenkins by defining 
the Library Source on the Folder. 
== Library Source Structure
In general, individual libraries are just directories within the configured library source. 

The library is referenceable in your ``pipeline_config.groovy`` file via the directory name. 

Each groovy file within a library directory (besides the library configuration file) will be loaded
as a step invokable from a pipeline template where the step name is equal to the base file name. 

== Library Providers
Libraries can come from different sources.  The current two storage mechanisms for libraries are Source Code 
Repositories and packaging libraries into a separate Jenkins plugin. Both of these options have benefits and 
draw backs that are outlined on their respective pages.
