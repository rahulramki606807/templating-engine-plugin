== Plugin Library Provider

JTE makes it possible to package a set of libraries into a Jenkins
Plugin.

When a library-providing plugin has been installed, a new option becomes
available when selecting a library source:

After selecting `From a Library Providing Plugin`, just select the
library providing plugin from the autopopulated dropdown list.

=== Why package libraries this way?

It's a lot less work to configure a source code repository and configure
it as a library source. So why would someone want to spend the time
packaging their libraries as a Jenkins Plugin?

*1. Plugin Dependency Management*

____
[verse]
--
Steps contributed by libraries often rely on Jenkins plugins in their implementation. Packing libraries as a
Jenkins Plugin ensures that all other plugin dependencies (and their versions) are satisfied when the library
providing plugin is installed.

*2. Initialization Performance*

____
[verse]
--
It slows down library loading to reach out to a remote source code repository to retrieve libraries.
When libraries are packaged in a Jenkins Plugin, library loading can be sped up significantly.

*3. Ensuring a specific version of JTE*

____
[verse]
--
It can be helpful to ensure that specific version of the Templating Engine Plugin is installed if the
interface between JTE and libraries is changed.

*4. Library Source Versioning*

____
[verse]
--
One specific use-case for the Templating Engine Plugin is for DevOps engineers supporting multiple pipelines
simultaneously. In these situations, the libraries provided are likely shared across the teams as well.
Over time, libraries can be changed in a way that breaks backwards compatibility. Packaging libraries as
a plugin allows you to version your set of libraries as an artifact where teams can upgrade when it makes
the most operational sense.

=== Building the Plugin

Building the plugin leverages

==== Sample Repository

We have created a sample repository you can use as a launching pad for
packaging your libraries as a plugin.

Checkout the
https://github.com/steven-terrana/jte-libs-as-plugin.git[jte-libs-as-a-plugin]
repository to get started.

=== Development Workflow

If packaging your libraries via a Jenkins Plugin, we recommend
configuring your library source as a link:../../../Library_Development/1/library_sources/scm_library_provider.html[SCM Library] during
development.

If you're following the repository template based off of the sample
repository mentioned above, you would configure the SCM Library
repository URL and set the base directory to
`src/main/resources/libraries`.

This way, you can continuously push updates to the remote repository for
testing, and only once you're satisfied with the changes, increment the
version and package the libraries as a plugin.
