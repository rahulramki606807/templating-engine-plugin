//[[GitHub Organization Job]]
== GitHub Organization Job

JTE can be used to apply a pipeline template to an entire GitHub
Organization by creating a *GitHub Organization* job in Jenkins.

To configure this, under the *Projects* section you will set the
*Project Recognizer* as `Jenkins Templating Engine` (as shown below)

=== Repository Configuration

Note, the *GitHub Organization* project can configure a *Governance
Tier* for specifying pipeline templates, library sources, and applying a
pipeline configuration to every branch of every repository in a GitHub
Organization.

You can find these settings under the `Jenkins Templating Engine`
section of the job configuration, as shown below:
