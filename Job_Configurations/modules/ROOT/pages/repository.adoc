//[[Multibranch Job]]
== Multibranch Job

JTE can be used to apply a pipeline template to an entire repository by
creating a *Multibranch Project*.

To configure this, under the *Build Configuration* you will set the
*mode* as `Jenkins Templating Engine` (as shown below)

=== Repository Configuration

Note, the *Multibranch Project* type can configure a *Governance Tier*
for specifying pipeline templates, library sources, and applying a
pipeline configuration to the entire repository.

You can find these settings under the `Jenkins Templating Engine`
section of the job configuration, as shown below:
