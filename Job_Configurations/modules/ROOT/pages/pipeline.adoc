//[[Pipeline Jobs]]
== Individual Pipeline Jobs

The most straight forward way test out a pipeline template is to create
a Pipeline job in Jenkins.

=== Select the Jenkins Templating Engine Pipeline Definition Option

A `Jenkins Templating Engine` pipeline definition is available when the
plugin is installed:

=== Configure the Pipeline

After selecting the `Jenkins Templating Engine` definition, you'll be
able to configure your *Pipeline Template* and *Pipeline Configuration*

image:pipeline/pipeline_configuration.png[image]

=== The Example

The example configuration above assumes you have configured a *Library
Source* that has a `maven` and `sonarqube` library contributing the
`unit_test`, `build`, and `static_code_analysis` steps.

The pipeline configuration defines a *Stage* called
`continuous_integration` which invokes the steps defined, in order.

Then, in the *Pipeline Template*, you will be able to invoke the
`continuous_integration` stage that was defined.
