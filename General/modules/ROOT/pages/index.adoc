== Jenkins Templating Engine

The https://plugins.jenkins.io/templating-engine[Jenkins Templating
Engine (JTE)] is a plugin developed by Booz Allen Hamilton enabling
pipeline templating and governance. JTE allows you to consolidate
pipelines into shareable workflows that define the business logic of
your software delivery processes while allowing for optimal pipeline
code reuse by pulling out tool specific implementations into library
modules.

JTE can do for your pipeline development.

=== How Does It Work?

The Jenkins Templating Engine works off the idea of pipeline templates
that define generically what should happen (and when) and accompanying
configuration files that populate the template with implementation
details.

=== Why Templating?

Pipelines are typically defined on a per application basis via a
`Jenkinsfile` in the source code repository. Often, common code can be
pulled out into Shared Libraries to reduce code duplication but a few
problems remain.

Organization's application portfolios often have a diverse technology
stack, each requiring their own pipeline-as-code integrations. It
becomes increasingly complex to manage these different implementations
across an organization while standardizing on the required software
delivery processes. For organizations with strict governance
requirements having a Jenkinsfile within the source code repository can
allow developers to bypass these mandatory requirements.

=== Organizational Governance

The real power of JTE comes from creating shareable workflows and using
them across teams. JTE allows you to create a centralized hierarchical
governance for your pipeline configurations that aligns to your
organizational structure. With governance tiers, organizations can
accelerate enterprise adoption by creating inheritable pipelines that
share common configurations.

=== Optimize Code Reuse

JTE allows you to share pipeline code effectively across multiple teams
through the use of common pipeline libraries.

=== Simplify Pipeline Maintainability

When supporting pipelines for multiple applications it becomes more
challenging to maintain the associated complexity. Multiple tech stacks
and tool integrations can lead to largely similar Jenkinsfiles with
distinct differences around how specific parts of the pipeline function.

JTE embraces the traditional software development practices of
modularity and separation of concerns to create a more organized code
base for your pipelines.
